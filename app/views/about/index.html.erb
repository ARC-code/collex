	<p><strong>NINES</strong> is a scholarly organization devoted to forging links between the material archive of the nineteenth century and the digital research environment of the twenty-first.

	Our activities are driven by three primary goals:
	<ul>
	<li>to serve as a <a href="scholarship/peerReview.html">peer-reviewing body</a> for digital work in the long 19th-century (1770-1920), British and American;</li>
	<li>to support scholarsâ€™ priorities and best practices in the creation of digital research materials;</li>
	<li>to develop <a href="software/index.html">software tools</a> for new and traditional forms of research and critical analysis.</li></ul></p>
	<p>The NINES <a href="../search">Collex interface</a> is at the center of these efforts. It aims to gather the best scholarly resources in the field and make them fully searchable and interoperable; and to provide an online collecting and authoring space in which researchers can create and publish their own work.</p>

	<p><strong>NINES</strong> also is home to <a href="http://juxtasoftware.org" target="_blank">Juxta</a>, a tool for comparing and collating multiple documentary instances of the same work; and to <a href="http://ivanhoegame.org" target="_blank">Ivanhoe</a>, a collaborative game-space for interpreting textual and other cultural materials. Other interpretive tools and applications are in the planning stages.<p/>

	<div class="grayBox"><img src="../images/right_arrow.jpg" float="left"></img><p>Each summer, <strong>NINES</strong> hosts a summer <a href="community/workshop.html">workshop</a> to assist scholars in their development of digital research projects in nineteenth-century studies. Our goal is to encourage attention to <a href="scholarship/peerReview.html">data structure</a>, <a href="../scholarship/rdf.html">interoperability</a>, and <a href="scholarship/rdf.html#sustainability">sustainability</a> as these projects go forward.
