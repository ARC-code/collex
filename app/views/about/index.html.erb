	<p>NINES is a scholarly organization devoted to forging links between the material archive of the nineteenth century and the digital research environment of the twenty-first.

	Our activities are driven by three primary goals:
	<ul>
	<li>to serve as a <a href="about">peer-reviewing body</a> for digital work in the long 19th-century (1770-1920), British and American;</li>
	<li>to support scholarsâ€™ priorities and best practices in the creation of digital research materials;</li>
	<li>to develop <a href="tools">software tools</a> for new and traditional forms of research and critical analysis.</li></ul></p>
	<p>The NINES Collex interface is at the center of these efforts. It aims to gather the best scholarly resources in the field and make them fully searchable and interoperable; and to provide an online collecting and authoring space in which researchers can create and publish their own work.</p>

	<p>NINES also is home to <a href="http://juxtasoftware.org" target="_blank">Juxta</a>, a tool for comparing and collating multiple documentary instances of the same work; and to <a href="http://ivanhoegame.org" target="_blank">Ivanhoe</a>, a collaborative game-space for interpreting textual and other cultural materials. Other interpretive tools and applications are in the planning stages.<p/>

	<p>Each summer, NINES hosts a series of workshops to assist scholars in their development of digital research projects in nineteenth-century studies. Our goal is to encourage attention to data structure, interoperability, and sustainability as these projects go forward.
