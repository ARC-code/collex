	<p><span class="emph2">In essence,</span> NINES vets freely-available digital objects in nineteenth-century studies for scholarly integrity and aggregates metadata (or descriptive information) about them in a faceted search-and-browsing interface.  The objects themselves are accessible via links to the <a class="nav_link" href="/about/9swhitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">federated</a> websites that have contributed them.</p>
	
	<p><span class="emph2">Objects</span> need not have a one-to-one relationship with web pages.  In other words, a single web page can contain many objects (just as a book of poetry contains many poems).  NINES contributors determine the level of object granularity appropriate to their material.  In this way, NINES <i>embodies</i> interpretive acts.  The sharing of semantic metadata about these objects makes it possible for NINES users to explore 19th-century online scholarship along many dimensions, as well as to produce personal annotated collections and exhibits using an integrated tool, <a class="nav_link" href="http://www.collex.org" target="_blank">Collex</a>.  In this way, NINES <i>enables</i> interpretive acts!
