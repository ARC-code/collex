The Collex project

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Prerequisite

Most of the pain of getting collex running is in getting Ruby on Rails running on your machine. Before attempting the
instructions below, be sure that you can create a simple Rails application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Steps for creating a collex installation from scratch.

The following steps are explained in detail below:

1) From the Collex repository, download Collex, solr, and (for the development computer only:) rdf-indexer
2) Install the required gems
3) create site.yml and database.yml
4) Start solr
5) Index some documents
6) Run: rake RAILS_ENV=production collex:update
7) Modify About pages
8) Install Wordpress
9) Skin it by changing the css files.
10) add robots file.
11) Start the daemons.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Initial username

After doing the initial migration, a single user has been created:

User name: admin
Password: password

As soon as the site becomes active,
1) sign on using those credentials,
2) switch to the "My Collex" tab, [NOTE: This tab can be renamed below]
3) click "Edit Profile", and change the user name and password to a less obvious one.

You may use the administrator account for your daily use of collex, or you may choose to create a separate
account for using the site. The difference is that the administrator has the "Admin" link that allows maintenance
of the site, and the administrator has a few more privileges, like the ability to delete anyone's post in the
forum and the ability to edit anyone's exhibits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Requires Wordpress for the News tab

There are instructions for integrating Wordpress that you can read by navigating to "/news".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Requires ARC Catalog

A connection to the ARC Catalog is needed. You can create that yourself or connect to a current instance. To use
a current instance, contact someone to get set up. To create your own version, download and set up the Catalog
project in Collex.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that you will need to index your documents first and put those indexes in the above folder. If you are using
the existing Catalog connection, you will probably submit your RDF to ARC for indexing. If you are setting up your
own catalog, you will have to index the documents yourself.

That process is explained here:

	http://www.performantsoftware.com/nines_wiki/index.php/Indexing_Tools

There is another relevant project in this repository to help with indexing:

	collex/trunk/rdf-indexer	: This is a java project that builds the utility that is used to read the rdf files into solr. The jar file created
		here is used by the rdf indexing rake tasks.

There are two indexes used: "resources" and "UserContent"
In the solr.xml file, you will need the following:
  <core name="resources" instanceDir="./"/>
  <core name="UserContent" instanceDir="./" schema="schema_user.xml"/>

Note that the name UserContent comes from the site.yml file. That allows more than one installation on a single computer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** deploying js and css

The JavaScript in Collex heavily uses prototype and YUI.

When running in production mode, different js and css files are used. The files are compressed and concatenated.

When running in development mode, the js and css files are not touched.

That means that there is no penalty for creating lots of small js and css files and commenting them copiously, because that will
be stripped out of the deployed site.

Each page has its own compressed js and css file.

In production, there are two css files on a page:
- the one for the YUI resources (directed to the Yahoo page so our server doesn't need to handle it)
- the specific one for the page (this is all of our css files compressed and concatinated.)

In production, there are three js files on a page:
- the one for the prototype files, compressed and contatinated.
- the one for the YUI resources (directed to the Yahoo page so our server doesn't need to handle it)
- the specific one for the page (this is all of our js files compressed and concatinated.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Custom rake tasks

In /lib/tasks/*.rake, there are a number of rake tasks defined. Here are the most important ones:

--- Development side ---
	rake deploy:compress_about_css
	Compress the css for the about pages - this is done when deploying, but needs to be done manually on your development machine.

	rake jslint:all
	(Runs jslint on all non-minimized js files in /public/javascripts.)

	rake jslint:file
	(Runs jslint on one file.)

--- Server side ---
	rake deploy
	This does various things depending on what is defined in site.yml. See the file collex.rake for details about what is
	updated for each type. The various things that are done are:
	- download latest code
	- run migrations
	- compress js and css files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Site specific info

There are two files missing from this installation that you must supply:

config/database.yml (there is a sample version of this file called config/database.example.yml)
config/site.yml (there is a sample version of this file called config/site.example.yml)

Add a robots.txt file to the /public folder. This should contain

User-agent: *
Disallow:

if you want search engines to find it, and

User-agent: *
Disallow: /

if you don't.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** About files

The "about" files are all created in WordPress and attached using the same method as the News blog.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Daemons

There are daemons that have to be running in the background all the time. To run them, type:
	RAILS_ENV=development script/daemons start|stop|restart

The default is production, so you can leave off the RAILS_ENV on your deployed sites.

Also, the daemons are running a different process, and won't see code changes unless they are restarted, so while
developing them, be aware of when you've changed code that a daemon will execute, and restart the daemons then.

For responsiveness, the daemons wake up every 5 seconds, but then have a second timer that can be set in site.yml,
so they don't actually do much when they wake up except see if they need to end.
