<p><span class="subhead">~ nineteenth-century scholarship ~</span><br />
Over the past ten years a growing body of digital scholarly work has been appeared online, nearly all of it executed without peer review processes and none of it integrated except by hyperlinking. NINES is working to establish an integrated publishing environment for aggregated, peer-reviewed online scholarship centered in nineteenth-century studies, British and American.</p>

<p><span class="subhead">~ and a scholarly collective ~</span><br />
NINES believes it is clearly in the interest of scholars to coordinate our work. We know that the migration of scholarship from paper-based to digital platforms and networks, already underway, will proceed apace. We scholars and educators must act on our own behalf if we are to help shape the form and result of this migration. To that end, NINES was created as a way for excellent work in digital scholarship to be produced, vetted, published, and recognized by the discipline.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.nines.org/collex" target="_blank"><div class="flashy"><center>Try out the NINES/Collex system online now!</center></div></a></p> 

<p>NINES will liaise with interested publishing venues on behalf and in the interests of scholars and educators and the work we produce. NINES will include various kinds of content: traditional texts and documents &#8212; editions, bibliographic entries, and critical works of all kinds &#8212; as well as "born-digital" materials relating to all aspects of nineteenth-century culture. NINES will be a model and working example for scholarship that takes advantage of digital resources and internet connectivity, while allowing scholars to integrate their contributions fully into their local IT environments. It will provide scholars with access to a federated digital environment and a suite of computerized analytic and interpretive tools. A key goal of NINES is to go beyond presenting static images or transcriptions of manuscripts on-screen. Software tools that aid collation, comparative analysis, and enable pedagogical application of scholarly electronic resources expose the richness of the electronic medium.</p>

<p>Most important, NINES is not just a committee of concerned scholars who mean to discuss the problems and opportunities presented by digital technology.  NINES is a practical undertaking and it is already underway.  It has a five-year plan with the following goals:
<ul>

        <li>To gather a significant body of digital scholarship and criticism of every kind under the auspices of NINES, in order to test various approaches to the publication of aggregated and peer-reviewed content;

        <li>To set up the editorial (and technical) framework and resources for producing new and ongoing digital scholarship that meets the highest professional and technical standards;

        <li>To develop a suite of easily-accessible and usable digital tools that will help scholars and students produce their work in digital form;

       <li>To run a series of <a href="../join/workshop.html">summer fellowships</a> for scholars who are working on digital projects (starting in 2005).  Successful fellowship applicants will be funded for a week-long workshop where they can develop their project, assisted by other scholars doing similar work and in a technical support environment of the highest caliber.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The chief function of NINES is to protect, sustain, and enhance digital scholarship and criticism in "the long 19th century."  Developing an aggregated body of peer-reviewed scholarly and educational tools and materials will have a significant impact in several important areas of our work:
<ul>
        <li>It will create a robust framework to support the authority of digital scholarship and its relevance in tenure and other scholarly assessment procedures.

        <li>It will help to establish a real, practical publishing alternative to the paper-based academic publishing system, which is in an accelerating state of crisis.

        <li>It will address in a coordinated and practical way the question of how to sustain scholarly and educational projects that have been built in digital forms.

        <li>It will establish a base for promoting new modes of criticism and scholarship promised by digital tools.
</ul></p> 

<p>The NINES Steering Committee first met in Charlottesville VA on 27-28 March 2004 to begin setting the foundation of NINES as well as its plans for initial action.  Three <a href="../contributors/boards.html">editorial advisory boards</a> were established: British Romanticism; British Victorian Studies; and Nineteenth-Century American Studies.  Some of the best existing <a href="../contributors/associations.html">digital projects</a> in these fields are represented on the NINES steering committee and these projects are willing to be represented in the NINES consortium, including  Romantic Circles, the William Blake Archive, the Whitman Archive, The Rossetti Archive, the Swinburne Project, and <i>Romanticism on the Net</i>, among <a href="../contributors/projects.html">others</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, a <a href="../contributors/staff.html">software development group</a> (headed by Jerome McGann) is working under the auspices of NINES to assemble a suite of <a href="../tools/index.html">critical and editorial tools</a> that can aid students and scholars who are involved in digital scholarship or who want to be.  The tool most critical to the success of NINES is <a href="http://www.patacriticism.org/collex">Collex</a>, designed by <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/~bpn2f">Bethany Nowviskie</a> as an integrated environment for exploring, annotating, and sharing digital resources.</p>
<p>The NINES Steering Committee is made up of the following scholars: 
<ul>
<li>Stephanie Browner</li>
<li>John Bryant</li>
<li>Jay Clayton</li>
<li>Morris Eaves</li>
<li>Michael Eberle-Sinatra</li>
<li>Dino Felluga</li>
<li>Neil Fraistat</li>
<li>Sharon Harris</li>
<li>Steve Jones</li>
<li>Mark Kamrath</li>
<li>George Landow</li>
<li>Laura Mandell</li>
<li>Jerome McGann</li>
<li>Joel Myerson</li>
<li>Ken Price</li>
<li>Martha Nell Smith</li>
<li>Andy Stauffer</li>
<li>Perry Willett</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In October of 2005, the steering committee met again in Charlottesville and endorsed a federated model for the practical development of NINES.  This model of online scholarship allows contributors to integrate their digital materials fully within their <i>own</i>, local IT environments, while still constituting a powerful aggregated resource open to full-text search, faceted browsing, and user collection, annotation, and re-purposing.  The federated model and its instantiation in the Collex tool is outlined in a <a href="9swhitepaper.pdf">white paper</a>.  A less technical description of Collex and the federated model is available <a href="Nowviskie-Collex.pdf">here</a>.
