<p>Over the past ten years a growing body of digital scholarly work has been appeared online, nearly all of it executed without peer review processes and none of it integrated except by hyperlinking. NINES is working to establish an integrated publishing environment for aggregated, peer-reviewed online scholarship centered in nineteenth-century studies, British and American.</p>

<p>NINES believes it is clearly in the interest of scholars to coordinate our work. We know that the migration of scholarship from paper-based to digital platforms and networks, already underway, will proceed apace. We scholars and educators must act on our own behalf if we are to help shape the form and result of this migration. To that end, NINES was created as a way for excellent work in digital scholarship to be produced, vetted, published, and recognized by the discipline.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.nines.org/collex" target="_blank"><div class="flashy"><center>Try out the NINES/Collex system online now!</center></div></a></p> 

<p>NINES will liaise with interested publishing venues on behalf and in the interests of scholars and educators and the work we produce. NINES will include various kinds of content: traditional texts and documents &#8212; editions, bibliographic entries, and critical works of all kinds &#8212; as well as "born-digital" materials relating to all aspects of nineteenth-century culture. NINES will be a model and working example for scholarship that takes advantage of digital resources and internet connectivity, while allowing scholars to integrate their contributions fully into their local IT environments. It will provide scholars with access to a federated digital environment and a suite of computerized analytic and interpretive tools. A key goal of NINES is to go beyond presenting static images or transcriptions of manuscripts on-screen. Software tools that aid collation, comparative analysis, and enable pedagogical application of scholarly electronic resources expose the richness of the electronic medium.  <a href="index.html">[read more]</a></p>
