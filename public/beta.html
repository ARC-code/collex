<p>The technical staff at NINES continues to refine and improve the Collex application, even as it is implemented in NINES. While most of its features are in place, access to some of them, such as the Exhibit Builder, is currently restricted to a small group of beta testers for further development.</p>

<p>As we prepare for our official software release of Collex in December of 2008, feedback and bug reports from our users are warmly welcomed. If you encounter technical difficulties using Collex, please contact us at <a href="mailto:technologies@nines.org">technologies@nines.org</a>.</p>
