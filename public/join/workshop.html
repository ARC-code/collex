					<p>NINES sponsors summer workshops to promote the development of computerized scholarly projects in 19th-century British and American literature and cultural studies.  NINES workshops will bring a dozen or more scholars together to work on their individual projects in an environment where they can interact with other scholars who are also doing digital projects in closely related historical and cultural areas.  NINES will make available to these scholars the tools and development expertise that have become a major part of the culture of digital humanities during the past 10+ years, and may offer financial aid to applicants.</p>
					
					<p>NINES is no longer accepting applications to the Summer '08 workshop at Miami University in Ohio. For more information on its agenda and attendees, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.lib.muohio.edu/literature/index.php/NINES0708">workshop wiki</a>, including useful readings for those interested in digital scholarship in the humanities.</p>
