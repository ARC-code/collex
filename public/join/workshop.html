					<p><b>Summer workshops</b>:  NINES is sponsoring a series of summer workshops to promote the development of computerized scholarly projects in 19th-century British and American literature and cultural studies.  The first set of workshops ran from the 11th to the 15th of July 2005 at the University of Virginia.  The location and focus of the next workshop (Summer 2007) has yet to be determined.</p>

<p>NINES workshops will bring a dozen or more scholars together to work on their individual projects in an environment where they can interact with other scholars who are also doing digital projects in closely related historical and cultural areas.  NINES will make available to these scholars the tools and development expertise that have become a major part of the culture of the humanities at institutions like MITH and IATH during the past 10+ years.</p>

<!-- <p>A <b>call for project applications</b> for places in the initial workshop is available in <a href="../events/workshop.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="../events/workshop.txt">text</a> format.  Projects will be vetted by the NINES editorial committees.  Participants may apply to NINES for financial aid.</p> -->
