												<div id="" class="grayBox"><p>The chief function of NINES is to protect, sustain, and enhance digital scholarship and criticism in "the long 19th century." Developing an aggregated body of <a href="peerReview.html">peer-reviewed</a> scholarly and educational <a href="../software/index.html">tools</a> and materials will have a significant impact in several important areas of our work:
<ul>
												   <li> it will create a robust framework to support the authority of digital scholarship and its relevance in tenure and other scholarly assessment procedures;</li>
												   <li>it will help to establish a real, practical publishing alternative to the paper-based academic publishing system, which is in an accelerating state of crisis;</li>
												    <li>it will address in a coordinated and practical way the question of how to sustain scholarly and educational projects that have been built in digital forms;</li>
												    <li>and it will establish a base for promoting new modes of criticism and scholarship promised by digital tools.</li>
												</ul>
												</div>
												
												<p class="header">Publishing Model</p>
												<p>NINES includes various kinds of content: traditional texts and documents — editions, bibliographic entries, and critical works of all kinds — as well as "born-digital" materials relating to all aspects of nineteenth-century culture. NINES is a model and working example for scholarship that takes advantage of digital resources and internet connectivity, while allowing scholars to integrate their contributions fully into their local IT environments. It provides scholars with access to a federated digital environment and a suite of computerized analytic and interpretive tools. A key goal of NINES is to go beyond presenting static images or transcriptions of manuscripts on-screen. Software tools that aid collation, comparative analysis, and enable pedagogical application of scholarly electronic resources expose the richness of the electronic medium.

												Over the past ten years a growing body of digital scholarly work has appeared online, nearly all of it executed without peer review processes and none of it integrated except by hyperlinking. NINES is working to establish an integrated publishing environment for aggregated, peer-reviewed online scholarship centered in nineteenth-century studies, British and American. NINES was created as a way for excellent work in digital scholarship to be produced, vetted, published, and recognized by the discipline.</p>
												
												<p>The NINES <a href="../scholarship/boards.html">editorial boards</a> continue to refine peer review procedures and solicit new resources. (See "<a href="submissions.html">submissions and review</a>.")  If you administer an existing online collection and would like to contribute freely-accessible online resources in nineteenth-century studies for peer review and possible inclusion in the NINES pilot, please contact us at <a href="mailto:inquiries@nines.org">inquiries@nines.org</a>. You can also reach the heads of our editorial boards at <a href="mailto:american@nines.org">american@nines.org</a>, <a href="mailto:romantic@nines.org">romantic@nines.org</a>, or <a href="mailto:victorian@nines.org">victorian@nines.org</a>.
