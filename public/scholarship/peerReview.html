					<p class="header"><img src="/images/peerReview_header.jpg" alt="peer review" /></p>
				<div class="grayBox">	<p>Digital humanities projects have long lacked a framework for peer
					review and thus have often had difficulty establishing their
					credibility as true scholarship. NINES exists in part to address this
					situation by instituting a robust system of review by some of the most
					<a class="nav_link" href="boards.html">respected scholars</a> in the field of nineteenth-century studies, British
					and American.</p></div>
					
					<p>NINES provides peer-review of digital resources and archives created by scholars in nineteenth-century studies. Our <a class="nav_link" href="boards.html">Editorial Boards</a> locate reviewers to evaluate both the intellectual content and the technical structure of each project submitted for inclusion in NINES. See <a class="nav_link" href="#new">below</a> for a set of General Guidelines and Peer Review Criteria.</p>
					
			
				<p>As part of the peer-review process, NINES requires the submission of	metadata describing the objects within the resource. This metadata (in the form of <a class="nav_link" href="rdf.html">RDF</a>) is largely based on fields such as author, title, data, and course. It also includes a set of genres relevant to nineteenth-century studies.</p>
				
				<p>A developed resource will be web accessible and have structured data (e.g. files coded in <a class="nav_link" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points" target="_blank">XML</a> or to accepted standards such as those of the <a class="nav_link" href="http://www.tei-c.org" target="_blank">TEI Consortium</a>).  The data should be encoded so that required <a class="nav_link" href="rdf.html">NINES metadata</a> can be extracted from the files.  (This <a class="nav_link" href="rdf.html">RDF metadata</a> is largely based on Dublin Core fields such as author, title, date, and source.  It also includes a set of genres relevant to nineteenth-century studies.)  In addition, the project should have the integrity expected of any work of scholarship.  It need not be "completed" but it should have a clear and finished conceptual design with substantial content in place.</p>
				
				<p>
					NINES resources can be either free culture/open access projects (i.e., projects whose content is distributed freely on the web under a Creative Commons license, is in the public domain, or falls under fair-use protection) or revenue-generating projects (like those of most journal publishers and university presses).  We have produced two documents addressing frequently asked questions about joining the NINES consortium: 
					<ul><li>a precis <a class="nav_link" href="freeculture.pdf" target="_blank">for "free culture" resources</a> in the humanities</li>
						<li>a precis <a class="nav_link" href="revenue.pdf" target="_blank">for revenue and subscriptions-based organizations</a>.</li>
						</ul>
				</p>

	<p class="header"><strong><a class="nav_link" name="new"></a>GUIDELINES FOR NEW PROJECTS</strong></p>
					<p>The NINES Executive Council has produced a set of <a class="nav_link" href="9s-guidelines.doc">General Guidelines and Peer Review Criteria for NINES Content</a>.</p>
					<p>Two questions are pertinent to the peer review criteria for NINES content: first, is the content important and interesting to existing scholarship; second, is the material presented in a clear, accessible, well-organized, and well-documented fashion? </p>
					
					<p><strong>I. Site Rationale and Content</strong></p>
					<p>NINES reviewers will evaluate site content and quality relative to existing scholarly and critical standards for print materials – critical books, scholarly editions, periodical publications.   NINES scholarship should be relevant to existing debates, concerns, and topics in the field of British and American literature and culture in the long nineteenth-century.  NINES submissions should come with a brief abstract and project summary.  If one is unclear about what to call a scholarly web site, the definitions of terms available at the <a class="nav_link" href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jah/websitereviews.shtml">Journal of American History</a> Web Site Reviews are immensely helpful and reflect a growing consensus among digital studies scholars regarding nomenclature. There, archive, electronic essay/exhibit, teaching resource, gateway, journal/webzine, organization, and virtual community are defined.</p>
					
					<p><strong>II. Interface Design and Usability</strong></p>
					<p>Projects included in NINES are required to meet certain technical standards that allow the project’s data to be aggregated for interoperability with other NINES resources. </p>
					<p>Beyond that, scholars are free to organize and design their materials as they judge best, given the purposes and goals of the project.  In this respect NINES wants to encourage scholars to think in fresh and imaginative ways about how to organize and present their work in digital forms.</p>
					<p>General standards for good interface design and site usability are widely available.  The NINES homepage provides references where scholars can find useful guides for interface design.  Key issues include layout, navigation, searchability, and documentation.  Contributors to NINES will be required to include an explicit “rationale” for their project that addresses these issues and any others that may be especially pertinent to the project.  NINES contributors might also want to consult human-computer interaction specialists at their home institution (if available).</p>
					
					<p><strong>III. Site Code and Documentation</strong></p>
					<p>As with interface design, various types of coding may be desirable for any given project.  The primary goal here is sustainability.  To that end, projects would do well to <strong>avoid proprietary formats</strong> unless overriding intellectual demands require their use.</p>
					<p>For text files, a <a class="nav_link" href="http://www.tei-c.org" target="_blank">TEI</a> application of XML is recommended unless – once again – overriding intellectual concerns justify an alternative schema.  Image and audio files should be prepared to known and current standards.  The many resources that describe and explain these standards are made available through the NINES website, where scholars can also find recommendations about programs that will help scholars prepare their data.</p>
			
				<p>	The MLA's "<a class="nav_link" href="http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_scholarly/cse_guidelines" target="_blank">Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions</a>" is another valuable resource. This set of General Guidelines and Peer Review Criteria established by the NINES <a class="nav_link" href="/community/council.html">Executive Council</a> can also be downloaded <a class="nav_link" href="9s-guidelines.doc">here</a>.</p>
